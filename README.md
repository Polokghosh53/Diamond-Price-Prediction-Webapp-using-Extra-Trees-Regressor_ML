The price prediction of the Diamond using Machine Learning based on the features used. The dataset used is cleaned and validated before use. The prediction is done and saved as pickle file. 

DATASET: https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds

_This model has an accuracy of 98.01%_

### Dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Process:
* Run the ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
* After running all the code lines, a pickled file will be saved in your local directory.
* Open the PyCharm IDE and extract all the files(including the pickle file, namely `deployment_06062021` here) in PyCharm except the Jupyter Notebook.
* After that, run the dependency command on the terminal of the PyCharm. If it fails to run, go to `Settings`>`Dependencies` and from there `+` will be there and search and install the packages mentioned in the `requirements.txt`.
* Once done, write `streamlit run app.py` in the terminal and a local web application will open.
* Ready to run.


**Note:** The deployed pickled file cannot be shared due to the file size being more than 25MB. Will be uploaded if a request is received.

### Bug:
There is a form of bug problem which comes only during the output of the prediction value. Will be rectified once resolved, else it does not cause any form of error.
If found, please inform.
Thank you.
